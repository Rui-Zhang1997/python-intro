# Introduction
Python is a language designed for code conciseness and rapid prototyping. It is widely used in the mathematical and analytical fields due to its simplicity, flexibility, and extensibility as well as providing many libraries created for that purpose. However, it also forms the core stack of many of today's tech companies, such as every major tech company, reddit, dropbox amongst others. Therefore, it is very useful to be able to code in the language, both because it is used by many companies but also because you can stand up personal work extremely quickly.
